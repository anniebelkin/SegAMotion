# Video Segmentation Project

**Course:** Topics in Image Processing

**Status:** Project not started yet - planning and research phase in progress.

This project aims to identify background and foreground elements in video segments.

___

### Problem Statement:
The ability to separate moving objects (foreground) from the static background in video is a fundamental task in computer vision. This has applications in areas such as object tracking, video surveillance, and content creation.

**Goals:**
- Review and experiment with various background subtraction techniques
- Implement a working foreground/background separation pipeline
- Evaluate accuracy and runtime performance on video sequences
- Deliver a final report and demo

### Proposed Approach:
We are currently exploring various background subtraction techniques to differentiate between static and dynamic parts of a video.

**Potential Technologies:**
* Python
* OpenCV

### Next Steps:
Our immediate next steps include researching different background subtraction algorithms and setting up our development environment.
- Research and dataset preparation
- Implementation and initial testing
- Optimization and final integration
- Final report and presentation
